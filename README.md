How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  I can ensure that my software is functional and secure by using unit testing and validating all requirements through test cases. In this course, I learned about and relied on JUnit tests to verify expected behavior and confim edge cases and invalid inputs were handled correctly. Writing tests as I worked on the code helped me to catch problems early on. I also tested using input validation and enforcing constraints to different methods. 

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  I started by carefully reviewing all the requirements and drafting them into clear, testable conditions. A few examples of this would be constraints on character limits, required fields, and ensuring different objects that needed to be unchangable were all correct. Writing tests helped me to see how the system should respond to valid inputs and invalid inputs alike. This helps ensure that the program behaves exactly as the "customer" requests

How do I approach designing software?
  I approach software design by starting with the requirements and then building the program in pieces. I want to ensure that the code functions, and then test out different cases to see where I could improve or offer more clarity in my code. Writing unit tests was something new for me in this course, however, it helps to expose issues in my code logic, and adjust as I go.
